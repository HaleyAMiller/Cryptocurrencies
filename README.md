# Cryptocurrencies

The senior manager of an investment bank is looking to offer clients a new portfolio option for cryptocurrencies. In order to provide the clients the most information about cryptocurrencies, the current cryptocurrencies on the market were analyzed to identify any trends. To begin with, the raw data was processed for the model to be created and ran. Then, as the patterns in cryptocurrencies were unknown, a clustering algorithm was utilized to categorize the cryptocurrency data into four different clusters. With these clusters, the investment bank is now able to educate clients on trends in the new cryptocurrenices.
